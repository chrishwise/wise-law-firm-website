			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>David Wise is a partner of the firm. He focuses his practice in the areas of construction law and defects in complex construction disputes throughout the Nation. As a litigator and a licensed professional engineer, Mr. Wise uses his engineering background to quickly evaluate and address the complex and technical issues that arise in construction disputes. He has represented homeowners, commercial owners, general contractors, construction managers, subcontractors, suppliers, architects, engineers, and sureties in construction disputes. His engineering and legal experience are particularly helpful to prepare and resolve construction claims, including claims for impact and delay, acceleration, defective specifications, differing site conditions, change orders, and extra work. Mr. Wise also assists clients in resolving construction defect claims, including water intrusion, toxic mold, and insurance coverage disputes. Mr. Wise also lectures on construction related topics. Before forming his own firm, Mr. Wise was an Associate at Braude & Margulies, P.C., a nationally recognized boutique construction law firm, and at Spriggs Hollingsworth, both located in Washington, DC. In 1994, Mr. Wise started his own practice, and in 2005, he formed his current firm.</p>
