		<p>
		The construction industry is one of the largest in the United States and has contributed to the non-stop growth across the country, since World War II. In many cities, the demand for homes, apartments, commercial, and industrial buildings has outpaced the supply. Often the rush to complete projects, the reduction or elimination of trade apprenticeship programs and a variety of other factors can result in defective residential and commercial construction. Construction defects arise from poor workmanship, improper design, faulty materials or soil and slope instability, and affect habitability and cause a decrease in value. Increased costs are incurred to repair the damage and harm caused. Defects fall into two categories. Certain defects, such as water intrusion, cracks in exterior stucco or interior drywall, leaky windows, doors or roofs, are called patent defects. Other defects, referred to as latent defects, are those that may be hidden and surface over time. Latent defects include plumbing and electrical system problems, toxic mold, sagging floors, and heating and cooling mechanism failures.
